				<br>
Tux Math 1.9.0 has been released in source code form and as an executable win32 installer.  This release features LAN multiplayer action - all players compete to answer the same questions, and the first correct answer gets the points!  For the first time, the Windows build has proper library support to correctly display non-Western languages.  "Under the hood", the extensive code reworking has mostly been completed, so users can expect to see a resumption of work on improved visible features.  Most TuxMath users will want to obtain this significant upgrade.<br /><br />
