Tux4Kids is proud to report the release of TuxMath-2.0.0.  Complete source code and an executable windows installer are available here at our site.  The new release is a major enhancement.  Factoroids has been completely overhauled, for better gameplay as well as enhanced educational value.  The LAN game has been improved and stabilized, and the single-player Arcade games now feature exciting powerup comets.  There are also new music tracks, improved menus, and many bug fixes, including reliably working native language support.  Many translations have been added or updated.  It should be noted that most of the new features were added during Google Code-In, Google's Open Source contest for secondary school students aged 13-18.  Many students made valuable contributions, but special recognition is in order for Aviral Dasgupta and Johndhel Maceda, who made very important programming contributions.  <br> <br>
Note - starting with this release, we are providing GPG signature files and both sha1 and md5 hashes for all files, including the Windows binary installer.  These files can be used with the GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) to verify the integrity of the packages, and their origination from our project.  A GPG signature provides authentication equivalent to that provided by a SSL code-signing certificate, but without expense to a purely volunteer project such as Tux4Kids.  We realize that users encounter browser warnings when downloading our packages due to Alioth's use of self-signed SSL certificates, and also warnings at installation from "this package lacks a valid digital signature".  We are working with the Alioth admins to address this issue.  Hopefully, we will soon provide authentication that is simple, user-friendly, and supported by the dominant consumer operating systems.  In the meantime, we have furnished a robust mechanism to validate the packages for those who are concerned by the warnings.  Also, we provide the same packages for download at <a href=http://"sourceforge.net/projects/tuxmath"/>SourceForge.net</a> , where they can be downloaded without triggering any browser warnings.

Tux Math 1.9.0 has been released in source code form and as an executable win32 installer.  This release features LAN multiplayer action - all players compete to answer the same questions, and the first correct answer gets the points!  For the first time, the Windows build has proper library support to correctly display non-Western languages.  "Under the hood", the extensive code reworking has mostly been completed, so users can expect to see a resumption of work on improved visible features.  Most TuxMath users will want to obtain this significant upgrade.<br /><br />
