Tux4Kids is proud to report the release of TuxMath-2.0.0.  Complete source code and an executable windows installer are available here at our site.  The new release is a major enhancement.  Factoroids has been completely overhauled, for better gameplay as well as enhanced educational value.  The LAN game has been improved and stabilized, and the single-player Arcade games now feature exciting powerup comets.  There are also new music tracks, improved menus, and many bug fixes, including reliably working native language support.  Many translations have been added or updated.  It should be noted that most of the new features were added during Google Code-In, Google's Open Source contest for secondary school students aged 13-18.  Many students made valuable contributions, but special recognition is in order for Aviral Dasgupta and Johndhel Maceda, who made very important programming contributions.  <br> <br>
Note - starting with this release, we are providing GPG signature files and both sha1 and md5 hashes for all files, including the Windows binary installer.  These files can be used with the GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) to verify the integrity of the packages, and their origination from our project.  A GPG signature provides authentication equivalent to that provided by a SSL code-signing certificate, but without expense to a purely volunteer project such as Tux4Kids.  We realize that users encounter browser warnings when downloading our packages due to Alioth's use of self-signed SSL certificates, and also warnings at installation from "this package lacks a valid digital signature".  We are working with the Alioth admins to address this issue.  Hopefully, we will soon provide authentication that is simple, user-friendly, and supported by the dominant consumer operating systems.  In the meantime, we have furnished a robust mechanism to validate the packages for those who are concerned by the warnings.  Also, we provide the same packages for download at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxmath"/>SourceForge.net</a> , where they can be downloaded without triggering any browser warnings.

				<br>
This year's Google Code-In has just finished, and Tux4Kids received a lot of attention from the 13-18 year old students competing in the contest.  The students completed nearly 100 tasks to help enhance Tux Paint, Tux Math, and Tux Typing.  These tasks included both coding and non-code contributions, such as translations, artwork, and documentation. Many of the tasks added features that will be very visible to users, as opposed to the "infrastructure" work that has occupied much of our efforts recently.  In particular, Tux Math's "Factoroids" activity has been extensively reworked, and is greatly improved with respect to both learning and gameplay (i.e. fun!).  We hope to have new releases available in the next few weeks once the new code is fully tested and stabilized.<br /><br />
