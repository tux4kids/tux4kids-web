to Tux4Kids!</font><br />
				Tux4Kids develops high-quality 
software for kids, with the goal of combining fun and learning into an 
irresistable package.
				Our software is free: you can download 
it for use at home or onto hundreds of computers in a school. We 
support all major
				platforms, including Windows, 
Macintosh, and Linux/Unix. Our programs are used by people around the 
globe, and they have
				been translated into dozens of 
different languages. As open-source software, these programs can be 
freely extended or
				customized, and they are supported by 
active communities of volunteer developers.<br />
				Whether you're a parent, a teacher, or 
a kid, give Tux4Kids software a try!<br />

				Tux4Kids has been accepted as a participating organization for 
				Google's 2010 Summer of Code.  As noted previously, interested 
				university students should follow the developer mailing lists and 
				familiarize themselves with the source code for the project(s) of 
				their interest. In 2009, Tux4Kids was allocated five student slots by 
				Google.  So far, there is no word on whether that number will increase 
				or decrease for 2010. <br /><br /> 

				Note that this year we will be 
				emphasizing projects that are focused, well thought-out, and 
				completable within the GSoC 2010 time frame.  Successful projects 
				should be release-ready by the end of the summer, including testing, 
				documentation, and merging into the program's mainline ("master") 
				branch.<br /><br />

				Tux4Kids is planning to participate in Google's Summer of Code again for 2010.  We will be submitting our application to be a participating project within the next 24 hours, and will hear next week if we have again been accepted.  Interested students should follow the tuxmath, tuxtype, and tuxpaint developers' lists.  Also, take a look at the source code for our programs.  Instructions for cloning the git repositories for tuxmath and tuxtype are available elsewhere on this page, whereas information for Tux Paint is available at http://www.tuxpaint.org.<br /><br />

Further general announcements will be available here.  The specifics of the GSoC application process, and details concerning our participation, will be located at the <a 
href="http://socghop.appspot.com">GSoC website</a>.

						From the surrogate 
webmaster:<br />
						Tux4Kids has switched 
from Subversion to Git for its file repositories, including
						the files storing the 
content for this website. There is still a lot of great new
						code from last summer 
that needs some finishing touches. As the lack of recent
						releases seems to be 
an obstacle to further progress, I intend to post "as is"
						builds for TuxType and 
TuxMath.  For TuxType, 1.8.1 should be very feature-similar
						to 1.8.0, with several 
rough edges fixed.  For TuxMath, 1.8.0 will include a
						complete overhaul of 
the menu code with SVG-based graphics, as well as the first
						public view of 
LAN-based multiplayer support.  There will certainly be some rough
						spots, but I think we 
need to "release early and often" to keep the project moving.<br /><br

						<td>
						Version 1.8.0 of Tux 
Typing has been released and is available for download at this site.  
This release includes many new word lists and lessons, as well as 
all-new high-resolution background images and new music files for the 
"fish" game.  Additionally, Tux Typing 1.8.0 includes the first public 
release of the new word list editor from GSoC 2009 - it is now 
possible to create custom word lists from within Tux Typing itself.<br 
/>
												The 
source code and a Windows installer are available here at Alioth, and 
RPM packages can be obtained via the openSUSE build service <a 
href="http://software.opensuse.org/search">search page</a>.  Mac users 
are encouraged to check back for the OS-X build, which hopefully will 
be available in the next few days.
